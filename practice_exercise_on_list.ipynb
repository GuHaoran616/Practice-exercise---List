    "2. Similarly, accept a list of 10 grades (0 - 5). Each grade must be separated by a comma\n",
    "    2.1. Grades must be stored as integers after accepting them as inputs. (HINT: Use typecasting)\n",
    "3. Store in a variable both the names and the grades together. (HINT: Use zip())\n",
    "4. Display to the user the different options that they can choose from to interact with the program\n",
    "    4.1. First option is to view the student with the highest grade.\n",
    "    4.2. Second option is to view top three students with the highest grade (HINT: Use sorted())\n",
    "    4.3. Third option is to view the students with the lowest grade\n",
    "    4.4. Fourth option is to get the total number of students that failed\n",
    "    4.5. Quit the program\n",
